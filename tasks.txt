Tasks to add to the app:

1. Create a background thread in the backend to create a random blast every 1 second
2. Create a PNG instead of BMP - for now do it in the front-end
3. Shard the grid into 4 parts, still a single backend but handling multiple shards. 
   Each call should be for a specific shards
4. Backend replication - each shard has primary BE and replicas backends (for now allow misalignment on race condition)
5. Blast should allow BE-to-BE comminucation, to continue in other shards
6. Handle all race conditions
7. Persistency - full support for take down and start up
8. Backend failure - all should continue as normal
9. Background thread "cleaning up the mess"
10. Background thread with "moving" blast
11. In the front-end create multiple PNG images, and generate a video from them
