Tasks to add to the app:

* Shard the grid into 4 parts, still a single backend but handling multiple shards. 
   Each call should be for a specific shards
* Backend replication - each shard has primary BE and replicas backends (for now allow misalignment on race condition)
* Blast should allow BE-to-BE comminucation, to continue in other shards
* Handle all race conditions
* Persistency - full support for take down and start up
* Backend failure - all should continue as normal
* Background thread "cleaning up the mess"
* Background thread with "moving" blast
* In the front-end create multiple PNG images, and generate a video from them
